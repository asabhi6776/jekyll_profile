description: Docker is an open-source platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. It provides a way to package and isolate applications and their dependencies into a single, portable unit that can be run on any system with a Docker engine installed. This makes it easy to build, ship, and run applications in a variety of environments, such as local development, test, and production. Docker also offers a rich ecosystem of tools and services, such as the Docker Hub, that make it easy to manage and share containers and their images. This has made Docker a popular choice for developers and organizations looking to modernize their application development and deployment processes.
