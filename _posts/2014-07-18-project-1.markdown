description: Kubernetes (k8s) is an open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a way to deploy and manage applications in a distributed environment, helping to ensure that applications are always available and scalable to meet changing demand. K8s uses a declarative approach to management, allowing developers to specify the desired state of their application and the platform to ensure it is maintained. With a large and active community, K8s has become the de facto standard for managing containers in production.
